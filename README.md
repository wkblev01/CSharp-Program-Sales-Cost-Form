# CSharp-Program-Sales-Cost-Form

C# program written by William Blevins for CIS 199

This C# program creates a form with a combo box to select a state and accepts text input for a product code and quantity. Form uses parallel arrays and for loops to match inputs with product price, tax, and discount. These totals are then calculated and output to the form.
